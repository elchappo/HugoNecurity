<h2 id="Summary"> <a>Summary </a> </h2>
<p>
A couple of weeks ago I was in sunny Las Vegas for DEFCON27, this is a quick post looking at some of the talks from the event, and a collection of some of the content I found to be particularly good. <!--more-->
</p>
<p>
Given the cost of attending DEFCON from the UK, it's good to take a step back and look back at the experiance, keep track of what topics were particularly intersting or new and to convince myself that it was around £2000 of my own money well spent! (Spolier, it is deffinatley worth the cost, you don't need to spend £10,000 per person to go, and I am hoping to head across next year if the costs of the flights are not too much).

<p>
DEFCON is a hands on security conference who's main focus each year takes a different slant. Last year we had 1983, a year before total survellance, this year we had the much more upbeat: "Technology's Promise". Unlike most other confernces which revolve around just attending talks, demos, and marketing presentations, DEFCON (which does have the three aformationed things), has more going on. Numerous competions, parties, workshops, shenanigans, and just so much 'stuff' to listen to, or better have a go at. If you attend defcon with the attitued of just wanting to sit in on a talk and leave, it may not be the best conference for you (unless you are in communiting distance!).

<h2 id="Villages"> <a> The Villages, Challenges, Training</a> </h2>
<h3> The Villages</h3>
<p>
The villages hosted by DEFCON , look at a viarity of topics from physical attacks and lock picking to web applications and from social engineering to ethics, privacy, and biohacking. XX villages were hosted this year with a full listing and what they are about available in the <a href="https://"> DEFCON Archives</a>. Personally, I belive this is where the real value in defcon lies, as the main tracks are available either 2 weeks (with the Breifings pack) or a few months after the conference. Which in effect means unless a main track talk has some real world impact on your day to day job, or is about your product, most of them can be watched in time online for free.

Most of my time was spent between the villages in the Flamingo and Bellagio

<h2 id="Blackhat"> <a> Blackhat Breifings Pack  </a> </h2>
<p>
The blackhat breifings pack is great value if you are able to convince your company to pick it up. For $700, you recvice Containing all the Blackhat talks, All DEFCON main track talks, and a smattering of the village talks, arguably infinatly better value than attending Blackhat itself which cost $XXXX on the door this year. You are able to buy this after the conference, however the price is increased to $1099.

<h2 id="improvements"> <a> Could it be better?  </a> </h2>
<p>
Although DEFCON has many things which make it one of the best information security events of the year, there are always some niggles which could be improved. The first niggle is the shear size of the venue now. If you wanted to attend a talk in one track at 11, and then wanted to do something at 12, or even 1PM, good luck in getting in! With around 30,000 other people at the conference, getting into everything you want to see, or try everything you want to do is going to be impossible. With having to take into account a 20 to 30 miniute walk between the <furthest?> hotels this year, it quickly became impossible to see everything I wanted to see.

 * There is no way for me to say if you should go

 * Social aspect
